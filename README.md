I am a full-stack developer with an experience of ~4 Years in software engineering and building tech products. Being a passionate software engineer with a can-do attitude, I got a lot of opportunities to design the system architecture and build over them for numerous startups from scratch. 

I am born and brought up in Bhilai, India, and completed my bachelor's in engineering at Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg, India. I am a two-time Smart India Hackathon finalist, I built a team with my mentor to participate in this contest, and this gave me an understanding of how building a product in the real world works.

I joined my current organization when I was still in college as the first software developer and grew up to become the Chief Technology Officer of the company as we grew from 2 people to a 15+ people team. 

I love solving problems using tech and believe in getting things done. Developing products gets me going, and I strive for creating an impact with the work I do. 

Working at a startup from the beginning and the approach to never limit myself gave me an opportunity to work on a large number of technologies and solve complex problems, I have developed products using the following technologies - 

- Mobile Apps - React Native
- Web Apps - Angular, Angular JS
- Web Service & API - Node.js and Spring Boot
- Database - MySQL, MongoDB

I have a deep interest in Java and Javascript as well, I am amazed by the impact these technologies are creating in today's world. 

I am always open to working on new technologies and I believe these technologies are the tools with which someone can efficiently apply their software engineering skills.

Highlights of some of the problem statements which I worked upon - 

- Doing the real-time transaction with event-based architecture instead of traditional request-response architecture, I achieved this using sockets in the system.
- Integration of complete payment solutions to the system which includes payment gateway integration to customers and then doing payouts to vendors based on the business logic and calculations.
- Integrating offline support to mobile apps using SQLite to drive good UX.
- Improving the performance of a system by introducing indexes and keys to the RDBMS database.

During the journey, I learned about the importance of building a team and culture in an organization, also how it drives the growth of any company.

My current project demands me to work on Ruby on Rails and I am presently working on my ROR skills to contribute in a better way to the team.
